# Inventory management system

This is a full stack project for the jump bootcamp. The aim is to create a full stack React app.

## Libaries & frameworks used.

1. Bootstrap
2. Chart.js
3. Joi Validation
4. React
5. React-Redux
6. React-router-Dom

## To do:

### Popup

- [x] Refactor buttons to be dynamically generated, this will allow me to call them within forms, as well as place in footer at later date.
- [x] Refactor form to use child components that will allow me to dynamically generate each input.
- [] hook up form submit to local storage (This will be replaced by apis at later date)

### general

- [ ] Create static pages
- [ ] Create local storage wrapper
- [ ] Create charts
- [ ] Stuff I've no doubt missed.
